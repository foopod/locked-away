She won't reply to my facebook messages even though I know she is online. I just want her to talk to me, I know we kind of had a fight and I guess she needs her room. But fuck, I love her, I just want to hold her close and tell her everything is going to be alright.</p>"}, {"date": "2016-04-02", "entry": "<p>My mum made a snide remark to me today, I couldn't even at the time. But I told Elora, fucking big mistake that was. Then I told her to just ignore my mum. She accused me of letting my mum get to me, its not like she is trying to break us apart, she is just trying to look out for me.</p>"}]

I've never felt pain like this before. It hurt when I fell over pushing her away from me. It hurt when she kicked me in the ribs as I tried to get back up. It hurt when she grabbed me by the hair and told me never to talk to her again.</p><p>And then she left, that hurt the most.</p><p>I am struggling to type right now, but I know that if I don't write this down now then I never will.</p><p>She left me here, slumped in a pile on the floor, tears rolling down my face and my lip bloodied from her first hit.</p><p>I didn't even do anything wrong. I was always faithful. I always did as she asked. I love her, I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.</p>"}, {"date": "2016-04-03", "entry": "<p>I haven't heard from her all day. She won't reply to my facebook messages even though I know she is online. I just want her to talk to me, I know we kind of had a fight and I guess she needs her room. But fuck, I love her, I just want to hold her close and tell her everything is going to be alright.</p>"}, {"date": "2016-04-02", "entry": "<p>Mum made a snide remark to me today, I couldn't even at the time. But I told Elora, fucking big mistake that was. Then I told her to just ignore my mum. She accused me of letting my mum get to me, its not like she is trying to break us apart, she is just trying to look out for me.</p>"}, {"date": "2016-04-01", "entry": "<p>Had a fight with mum today.</p><p>I don't know why she doesn't like Elora. Haha, she even said that she was bad for me. I don't know where that is coming from either. Elora is the sweetest most delicate thing I can think of, I am the one getting us into shit.</p><p>And mum thinks I'm living in some sort of fantasy. She's the alcoholic that drinks to forget every night and I'm the delusional one.</p>"}, {"date": "2016-03-27", "entry": "<p>Opposites attract right? It is strange. She is likes clothes and lipgloss. And I like rock bands and Star Wars.</p><p>Something about her intrigues me. She is almost inhuman in how beautiful she is, every inch of her is perfect, not a hair out of place.</p><p>I'm excited when she is near. I can't put my finger on it, but she is like no one I have ever met. She is always kind, except when she needs to be harsh. She is always generous, except when she can't be. She seems to know everything, but is always the first to admit when she doesn't know. She doesn't make mistakes, but when she does she owns up to it immediately.</p><p>I love her.</p>"}, {"date": "2016-03-22", "entry": "<p>Woops. Haven't been keeping up with my journal entries. Elora is such a distraction.</p><p>We did something mischevious today.</p><p>Oops.</p><p>There is this old abandoned store at the end of the main road, can't remember what it used to be, but it has been boarded up for years. Anyway, last time we went past it some of the rafters had come down and we could see inside. Right at the back covered in an old sheet is what we suspected to an old manikin.</p><p>I can tell you right now that we guessed right. And Elora thought it could be a neat way to show off the dress she had made in her fashion design paper. </p><p>Haha. So now it's sitting in my closet. After took it Elora had some regrets and thought her Dad would get angry if he saw it. Maybe I would be so lucky to have her dress on display here in my room.</p>"}, {"date": "2016-03-15", "entry": "<p>I went to see Elora after class today. But as soon as I got there she broke down in tears. Someone at class had a made a rude comment about her work behind her back.</p><p>It didn't seem like they meant for her to hear them, but it was still really harsh.</p><p>Why are people so cruel? It's something I see time and time again. If you don't have anything nice to say then keep you fucking mouth shut!</p><p>I want to give these dickwads a stern talking too, but Elora told me just to leave it be.</p><p>It's just that she worked so fucking hard on that dress. So many late nights, so much research and so many other papers that suffered. It truly was a labour of love.</p>"}]

I bought them.</p><p>I am in fucking love with this girl.</p><p>Okay, so she is sitting here while I write this entry. I can't really trash talk her. But yeah, we needed to talk it out, and maybe things got a little physical. Maybe that was a good thing.</p><p>We are good now.</p><p>I want to remember this moment forever. </p><p>So I took a pic of us.</p>"}, {"date": "2016-04-04", "entry": "<p>I'm scared. Now more than ever. </p><p>I don't know why she did it, I didn't think she was capable of that kind of thing. I've never felt pain like this before. It hurt when I fell over pushing her away from me. It hurt when she kicked me in the ribs as I tried to get back up. It hurt when she grabbed me by the hair and told me never to talk to her again.</p><p>And then she left, that hurt most of all.</p><p>I am struggling to type, but I know that if I don't write this now then I never will.</p><p>She left me here, slumped in a pile on the floor, tears rolling down my face and my lip bloodied from her first hit.</p><p>I didn't even do anything wrong. I was always faithful to her. I always did as she asked. I would never do anything to hurt her.</p><p>I love her.</p>"}, {"date": "2016-04-03", "entry": "<p>Elora must be busy today. I hope she is't too stressed out over her media assignment. Shes been obsessing over this thing for weeks.</p><p>Shes online, why won't reply to my facebook messages?

Next minute I'm being accused of letting it get to me.</p><p>I managed to talk her down, but boy that was a mission. I have never seen her like that before, but I guess it shows how much she cares for me.</p>"}, {"date": "2016-04-01", "entry": "<p>Mum and I had a fight today, maybe I haven't left that realm of teendom after all.</p><p>I don't know why shes not a fan of Elora. She even said that she was bad for me. I don't know where its coming from. Elora is the sweetest, most delicate thing I can think of, I am the one getting us into shit. If anything I am bad for her.</p><p>She thinks I'm living in some sort of fantasy.

She is likes clothes and lipgloss. And I like rock bands and Star Wars.</p><p>Something about her intrigues me. She is almost inhuman in how beautiful she is, every inch of her is perfect, not a hair out of place.</p><p>I get excited whenever she is near. I can't put my finger on it, but she is like no one I have ever met. She is always kind, except when she needs to be harsh. She is always generous, except when she can't be. She seems to know everything, but is always the first to admit when she doesn't. She doesn't make mistakes, but when she does she owns up to it immediately.</p><p>I'm in love.</p>"}, {"date": "2016-03-22", "entry": "<p>Woops. Haven't been keeping up with my journal entries. Elora is such a distraction.</p><p>We did something mischievous today.</p><p>Oopsy.</p><p>There is this old abandoned store at the end of the main road, can't remember what it used to be, but it has been boarded up for years. Anyway, last time we went past it some of the rafters had come down and we could see inside. Right at the back covered in an old sheet is what we suspected to an old manikin.</p><p>I can tell you right now that we guessed right. Elora has been making a dress for her fashion design paper. We thought it would be a neat way to show it off. </p><p>Haha. So now it's sitting in my closet.</p><p>After we took it Elora had some regrets and thought her Dad would get angry if he saw it. Maybe I could get lucky and have it displayed here.</p>"}, {"date": "2016-03-15", "entry": "<p>When I visited Elora today she broke down in tears. Someone at class had a made a rude comment about her work behind her back.</p><p>It didn't seem like they meant for her to hear them, but it was still really harsh.</p><p>Why are people so cruel? It's something I see time and time again. If you don't have anything nice to say then keep you fucking mouth shut!</p><p>I want to give these dickwads a stern talking too, but Elora told me just to leave it be.</p><p>It's just that she worked so fucking hard on that dress. So many late nights, so much research and so many other papers that suffered. It truly was a labour of love.</p>"}, {"date": "2016-03-04", "entry": "<p>She kissed me :D</p><p>Or I kissed her.</p><p>It all happened so fast. Haha.</p><p>We were sitting on my bed just talking about random shit and then out of nowhere she just leaned in and kissed me. Okay she definitely kissed me first.</p><p>We didn't talk about it either, her mum busted in with afternoon tea right afterwards.</p><p>I can't help but think of her in a different light. I can't deny that I hadn't thought about her like that. But she always seemed so proper, I never thought she might be gay.</p><p>Tehe, and now I'm all giddy like a school girl having her first crush.</p>"}, {"date": "2016-03-02", "entry": "<p>I think I annoy Elora's dad. She is so primp and proper and I'm the girl that hasn't worn a dress in her life.</p><p>Watching us walk up their driveway after class must be hilarious. Elora all dolled up in pink and me in my ripped jeans and flannel.</p><p>She doesn't look it on the outside, but she is a rebel at heart. I knew when we first talked that we would get along. We may not have any common interests, but we both think the same way.</p><p>Its just nice to have made a new friend, it's been hard making friends at uni. Everyone is always so busy.</p>"}, {"date": "2016-03-01", "entry": "<p>For fucks sake.</p><p>Like it's bad enough that it happened in the first place. But making me relive it on a weekly basis. This can't be good for my sanity.</p><p>I'd like to think that counselling is helping. But everything seems to remind me of him, I still break down in tears daily. It's hard being back at school, but I had to re-integrate with society eventually.</p>"}, {"date": "2016-02-27", "entry": "<p>Here it goes again...</p><p>Another journal entry...</p><p>Today I went to class. Such fun.</p><p>I guess it could have been worse. A new thrilling assignment from the plastics lecturer. We have to compare the spec sheets from different ABS manufacturers. </p><p>And after writing this I have a to study the safety guide for the arc welder. I'm pretty excited to do some welding, but apparently we need to ace test test first.</p><p>Tried that new pretzel place round the corner from uni today. I got one and dropped it, then a fucking seagull made off with it. It was pretty tragic. I would have tried to kill that gull if I had the energy. Some girl named Elora came up to me and gave me half of her pretzel. It was the nicest thing thats happened to me in a while.</p><p>We sat and ate together, it brightened my whole day.</p><p>#MakingNewFriends</p>"}, {"date": "2016-02-23", "entry": "<p>Here goes nothing. </p><p>Dad died last week.</p><p>Am I sad? Not really. </p><p>Am I a monster? Maybe.</p><p>Eh. It's not like he really added much to my life. Sure he was around, but never in a particularly positive way. I mean I guess I 'loved' him, I think.</p><p>Mum has got me going to a counseller now after the accident. She thinks it will hope me cope.</p><p>Not sure if I am comfortable talking to anyone about this, let alone a random stranger. But he told me that there's a history of mental illness in the family.

# Entry 1 (2016-04-04)
## Massive fight with girlfriend
Our character is scared, not for her own safety, of which soon it will be apparent that she should be. But scared because she doesn't want her girlfriend to break up with her, she doesn't want to let go of the only good thing in her life. They have just had a massive fight, things were broken, punches were thrown and words that cannot be unsaid were said.

# Entry 2 (2016-04-03)
## Radio Silence
Nothing, our character hasn't left the house, she hasn't done anything. She is concerned that she did or said the wrong thing. Her mum just doesn't understand it.

# Entry 3 (2016-04-02)
## Argue with Girlfriend about mum
Its just something my mum said, I want to be with you. Just ignore her. But she is getting to you, she is trying to break us apart, she is just trying to look out for me. Whose side are you on!?!?!

# Entry 4 (2016-04-01)
## Argue with mum about girlfriend
She is bad for you. You are ignoring the things in life that really matter and just living some stupid fantasy. (Mum is a fuckwit)

# Entry 5 (2016-03-27)
## In love
Never thought I would find someone I was so in sync with. Something crazy together. She chose me over something else really important to her. blah blah edgy but cute and romantic

# Entry 6 (2016-03-22)
## Can't keep up
Been spending so much time with her, haven't even been keeping up with my diary entries. We did something mischevious today.

# Entry 7 (2016-03-15)
## Girls made fun of her
Other girls at school made fun of her because she wasn't allowed to come out and play (wtf age are these characters), you get the idea.

# Entry 8 (2016-03-13)
## Actually hanging out a lot now
So glad to have finally made a new friend, its not easy you know.

# Entry 9 (2016-03-09)
## Hanging out after school
She is kind of cool, I like her wrecklessness, she would be a great friend for pissing off mum.

# Entry 10 (2016-03-05)
## Counselling
What a fucking drag? I fucking hate it, first this fucking happens, then I have to relive this shit every fucking week with a counseller. Is it supposed to help?

# Entry 11 (2016-03-02)
## Met someone new today
Finally something nice happened. Another girl told the bus driver to wait for me while I was struggling with my things.

# Entry 12 (2016-02-28)
## Journal Entries start
So my counseller tells me I need to start writing journal entries. There is a history of mental illness in the family and they are worried that my emotions may embody themselves elsewhere in my life if I don't have an outlet for them. So here goes nothing. Dad died last week, am I sad? No. Am I a monster? Maybe.

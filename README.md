#Story Ideas

+ The last entry is a doctors appointment where the main character is told they are schizophrenic, it is then immediately obvious that the diary belongs to only one of the split personalities.
+ The entries keep jumping further and further back in time, to the point where either the player would be a child and thus incapable of writing the journal entries or have lived for an unusually long time.
+ We find out that a prevalent character in the story is imaginary.

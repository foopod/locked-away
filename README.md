#Locked Away

This experience lets the player explore someones life by guessing the password to their online diary. The game was largely inspired by (Christine Love's Even Cowgirls Bleed)[http://scoutshonour.com/cowgirl/] as well as more interactive fiction like (Life is Strange)[http://www.lifeisstrange.com/].

It features reverse chronology, this sets it apart from a lot of stories, but it also made it a bitch to write.

Play it (here)[http://lockedaway.online].

I went to see Elora after class today. But as soon as I got there she broke down in tears. Someone at class had a made a rude comment about her work behind her back.

It didn't seem like they meant for her to hear them, but it was still really harsh.

Why are people so cruel? It's something I see time and time again. If you don't have anything nice to say then keep you fucking mouth shut!

I want to give these dickwads a stern talking too, but Elora told me just to leave it be.

It's just that she worked so fucking hard on that dress. So many late nights, so much research and so many other papers that suffered. It truly was a labour of love.

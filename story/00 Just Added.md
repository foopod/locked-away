So we talked.

I didn't know what to say. She didn't really either. She made excuses. I bought them.

I am in fucking love with this girl.

Okay, so she is sitting here while I right this entry. So I can't really trash talk her. But yeah. I think we did need to talk it out, and maybe things got a little physical. Maybe that was a good thing.

We are good now.

I want to remember this moment forever. So I took a pic of us.

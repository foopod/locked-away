Whoops. Haven't been keeping up with my journal entries. Elora is such a distraction.

We did something mischievous today.

Oopsy.

There is this old abandoned store at the end of the main road, can't remember what used to be in it, but it has been boarded up for years. Anyway, last time we went past it some of the rafters had come down and we could see inside. Right at the back covered in an old sheet is what we suspected to be an old manikin.

I can tell you right now that we guessed right. Elora has been making a dress for her fashion design paper. We thought it would be a neat way to show it off. 

Haha. So now it's sitting in my closet.

After we took it Elora had some regrets and thought her Dad would get angry if he saw it. Maybe I could get lucky and have her dress on display here.

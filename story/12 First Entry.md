Here goes nothing. 

Dad died last week.

Am I sad? No. 

Am I a monster? Maybe.

Eh. It's not like he really added much to my life. Sure he was around, but never in a particularly positive way. He was just around. I mean I guess I loved him.

Mum has got me going to a counseller now after the accident. She thinks it will hope me cope.

There is a history of mental illness in the family. This journal is an 'outlet' for everything that I am going through. He has seen problems in the past where emotions manifest themselves elsewhere in peoples lives.

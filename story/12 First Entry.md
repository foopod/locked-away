Here goes nothing. 

Dad died last week.

Am I sad? Not really. 

Am I a monster? Maybe.

Eh. It's not like he really added much to my life. Sure he was around, but never in a particularly positive way. I mean I guess I 'loved' him, I think.

Mum has got me going to a counseller now after the accident. She thinks it will help me cope.

Not sure if I am comfortable talking to anyone about this, let alone a random stranger. But he told me that there's a history of mental illness in the family. And this journal is supposed to be an 'outlet' for everything that I am going through. He has seen problems in the past where emotions manifest themselves elsewhere in peoples lives.

Mum made a snide remark to me today, I just couldn't even.

But I told Elora, fucking big mistake that was.

I tried to tell her to just ignore my mum, its not like she is trying to break us apart, she is just trying to look out for me. Next minute I'm being accused of letting it get to me.

I managed to talk her down, but boy, that was a mission. I have never seen her like that before, but it shows how much she cares for me.

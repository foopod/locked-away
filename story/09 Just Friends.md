I think I annoy Elora's dad. She is so primp and proper and I'm the girl that hasn't worn a dress in her life.

Watching us walk up their driveway after class must be hilarious. Elora all dolled up in pink and me in my ripped jeans and flannel.

She doesn't look it on the outside, but she is a rebel at heart. I knew when we first talked that we would get along. We may not have any common interests, but we both think the same way.

Its just nice to have made a new friend, it's been hard making friends at uni. Everyone is always so busy.

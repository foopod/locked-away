Mum and I had a fight today, maybe I haven't left that realm of teendom after all.

I don't know why shes not a fan of Elora. She even said that she was bad for me. I don't know where its  all coming from. Elora is the sweetest, most delicate thing I can think of, I am the one getting us into shit. If anything I am bad for her.

She thinks I'm living in some sort of fantasy. She's the alcoholic that drinks to forget every night.

And I'm the delusional one.

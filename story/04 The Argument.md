Had a fight with mum today.

I don't know why she doesn't like Elora. Haha, she even said that she was bad for me. I don't know where that is coming from either. Elora is the sweetest most delicate thing I can think of, I am the one getting us into shit.

And mum thinks I'm living in some sort of fantasy. She's the alcoholic that drinks to forget every night and I'm the delusional one.

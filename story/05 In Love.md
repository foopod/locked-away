Opposites attract. Its strange right? She is likes clothes and lipgloss. And I like rock bands and Star Wars.

Something about her intrigues me. She is almost inhuman in how beautiful she is, every inch of her is perfect, not a hair out of place.

I get excited whenever she is near. I can't put my finger on it, but she is like no one I have ever met. She is always kind, except when she needs to be harsh. She is always generous, except when she can't be. She seems to know everything, but is always the first to admit when she doesn't. She doesn't make mistakes, but when she does she owns up to it immediately.

I'm in love.

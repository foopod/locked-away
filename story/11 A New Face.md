Here it goes again...

Another journal entry...

Today I went to class. Such fun.

I guess it could have been worse. A new thrilling assignment from the plastics lecturer. We have to compare the spec sheets from different ABS manufacturers. 

And after writing this I have a to study the safety guide for the arc welder, pretty excited to do some welding. But apparently we need to ace a safety test first.

Tried that new pretzel place round the corner from uni today. I dropped it and fucking seagull made off with it. It was pretty tragic. I would have tried to kill that gull if I had the energy. Some girl came up to me and gave me half of her pretzel. It was the nicest thing ever.

We sat and ate together. She is studying art.

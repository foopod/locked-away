She kissed me :D

Or I kissed her.

It all happened so fast. Haha.

We were sitting on my bed just talking about random shit and then out of nowhere she just leaned in and kissed me. Okay she definitely kissed me first.

We didn't talk about it either, her mum busted in with afternoon tea right afterwards.

I can't help but think of her in a different light. I can't deny that I hadn't thought about her like that. But she always seemed so proper, I never thought she might be gay.

Tehe, and now I'm all giddy like a school girl having her first crush.

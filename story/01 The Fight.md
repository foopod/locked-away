I'm scared. Now more than ever. 

I don't know why she did it, I didn't think she was capable of that kind of thing. I've never felt pain like this before. It hurt when I fell over pushing her away from me. It hurt when she kicked me in the ribs as I tried to get back up. It hurt when she grabbed me by the hair and told me never to talk to her again.

And then she left, that hurt most of all.

I am struggling to type, but I know that if I don't write this now then I never will.

She left me here, slumped in a pile on the floor, tears rolling down my face and my lip bloodied from her first hit.

I didn't even do anything wrong. I was always faithful to her. I always did as she asked. I would never do anything to hurt her.

I love her.

For fucks sake.

Like it's bad enough that it happened in the first place. But making me relive it on a weekly basis can't be good for my sanity.

I want to think that counselling is helping. But everything seems to remind me of him, I still break down in tears daily. It's hard being back at school, but I had to re-integrate with society eventually.
